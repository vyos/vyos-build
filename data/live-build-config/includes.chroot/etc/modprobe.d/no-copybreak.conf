# Some network interface drivers employ a scheme known as "copybreak"
# in which they make a copy of a received skb if the size of the
# buffer is below a particular threshold, then return the original
# receive skb back to the pool.  Since these drivers initially
# allocate a buffer size that is larger than the largest possible
# packet, this scheme returns that large buffer to the pool quickly,
# and uses a smaller one.
#
# The primary benefit of copybreak is better memory utilization.  On
# systems where the data is ultimately going to be copied out to user
# space, the copybreak scheme is "low cost" because it has the side
# benefit of priming the cache for that later copy.  But on a router
# that only touches the header fields of a received packet, the cost
# can be relatively higher.  And on modern systems the memory savings
# is rarely an important consideration.
#
# Some of the drivers that employ copybreak make the feature
# configurable via a module parameter.  This file disables copybreak
# in some of those drivers.  Generally this results in an improvement
# in forwarding performance for traffic using these drivers.
